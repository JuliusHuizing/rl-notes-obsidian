# Convergence
* When using non-linaer functions, you typically converge to [[local optima]], if convergence is guaranteed at all (might also diverge in some cases).
* 
Any function that cannot be brought into linear form. 

E.g deep neural networks.

typically have some feed-froward function with linear weights and non-linear activation functions in between.
