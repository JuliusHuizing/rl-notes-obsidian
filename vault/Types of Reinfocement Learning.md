In general, there are two ways to learn a policy: either by doing [[Model-free RL]] or [[Model-based RL]]. Within both those realms, you can either use [[value-based methods]] or [[policy based]] methods.

Furthermore, an agent can follow [[hard strategies]] or [[softs strategies]].


Typically, RL is concenred with learning policies for [[Markov decision process (MDP)]].'s. These MDP's can be known, or unknown, which lead to different approaches for learning.
