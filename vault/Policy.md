The way actions are selected 

$$\pi(a|s)$$

for every state, the policy specifes a probability distribution over actions.

A good policy should get high [[expected (discounted) return]]s, expressed in the [[state-value function]]


a policy is optimal if:

$$ v_\pi(s) \geq v_{\pi'}(s) \forall s,\pi'  $$
