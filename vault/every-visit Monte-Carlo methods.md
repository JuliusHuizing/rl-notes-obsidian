Similar to [[First-visit Monte Carlo]], but the  expected return of a state is approximated as the average return from that state considering all times that state is visited.

always biased when using either [[Ordinary Importance Sampling]] or [[Weighted importance samplign]].


#checkme advantages?
* often preffered to first-visit mc because  easier to implement: it aciod the need to keep tack of which states have been visited previously.
* more easily extends to function approximation.
