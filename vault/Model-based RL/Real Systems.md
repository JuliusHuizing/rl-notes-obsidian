In RL, a real system is any system for which *complete* simulation is typically not available out-of-the-box, and for which, consequently, data is relatively hard to obtain. For example, chess-games now-adays typically straightforward to simulate and are not considered *real systems*, whereas car rides are typically not so readily available for simulation and would thus be considered a *real system*. 

Whether a system is considered a real system might change over time as technology progresses.


# Limitations of learning on real systems:

* Data is expensive / risky/ time-consuming to obtain.
* No counterfactuals, gradients. #todo
* On-policy migt not be posbbile. #todo
* No acces to distribution. #todo
